# KliniX
**KliniX** is **a project done by Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>

## What is KliniX?
* KliniX helps general clinic receptionists to quickly access and keep track of patient records, appointments, and medicine needs (for supply management).
* It is optimized for users who prefer a command-line interface (CLI), enabling faster completion of frequent tasks through typed commands.

## More about it
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a reasonably well-written code base bigger (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
* For user and developer documentation, head over to **[KliniX Documentation](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-t09-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)
